# TetradAnalysis
Java program to count fluorescent pollen tetrads

## Description
This program is for counting fluorescent pollen tetrads in three color intervals from fluorescently tagged lines (FTL) lines.  The original description of these lines can be found here:

For a thorough description of experimental design and data collection, see the publication below.  A description and image of the tetrad types (A-L) for three color intervals is also provided in this publication.

A tutorial on how to use the program is provided in the wiki (construction in process). The user is expected to either have three color image data (viewable in a program such as ImageJ/Fiji) from tetrads or to use the program as a tool for counting tetrads under a microscope. 

## Requirements
Requires Java 1.8
